      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am Suraj Mishra, a second year Computer Science Engineering Student at
        GGSIP university Dwarka. I am learning about blockchain and web3 since
        last year and now building Dapps on Ethereum and polygon blockchain
        using solidity, Truffle Ganache, etc.Currently reading "Mastering
        Ethereum" book so that I can understand Ethereum technology deeply and
        make secure and optimized smart contracts. I am also a web3 member of
        the Google Developer Student Club of my college, where my main motive is
        to learn, influence, and mentor my fellows about web3, and this is
        helping me in my teaching, public speaking, and other soft skills also.
