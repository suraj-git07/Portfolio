      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am Suraj Mishra, a second year Computer Science Engineering Student at
        GGSIP university Dwarka. It's been more than a year of learning Blockchain and web3, 
    and now building Dapps on Ethereum and polygon blockchain using tools like solidity, Truffle, hardhat Ganache, etc. 
    Recently I even started exploring Tezos blockchain and learning SmartPY for writing smart contracts or organizations. 
    I am currently a member of Tezos BuilderCamp1.0.

    I participated in many hackathons like ETHIndia 22, ETHForALL 23, and many more college-level and organizations hackathons to explore my tech skills and create projects with my team ThirdEye.
